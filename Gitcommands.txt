git add -u 

The command git add -u is used to stage changes to tracked files.
Specifically, it stages modifications and deletions, but not untracked files. 

Fetch Changes: Start by fetching the latest changes from the remote repository:
git fetch

Identify Modified Files: Use git diff to see which files have been modified between your current branch and the origin/main branch:
git diff --name-only origin/master

Pull Modified Files: Once you've identified the modified files, you can use git checkout to pull these modified files from the origin/main branch into your current branch:
git checkout origin/main -- .

Commit Changes (if needed): After pulling the modified files, you might want to commit these changes to your branch:
git commit -m "Pulled modified files from origin/main"
